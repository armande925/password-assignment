password generator

UCBX Assignment to create a password generator using javascript

::INTRO::

This project was challenging. I find that throughout the course of each assignment tends to be slightly more difficult and attainable at the same time. Having gained a few more tools, the implementation of previously learned skills is easier, while executiopn of the most recent studies remains a challenge. My tutor was vital in helping me to complete this task. I could have styled it a bit more, but I focused my energies on retaining the information I had learned. This project was very interesting beacuse it was my first glimpse into the code and how it can be implemented into security measures as well and decoding issues involving security. Creating an algorithm that can potentially crack a password. Hacker stuff !

::ABOUT::

This assignment was given the third week of school. The task was to build an applictaion that allowed the user to enter certain perameters, which once stated, would render a password the user could then copy. Although the target was to make this random, certain aspects were not random due to the fact that the user selects the guidelines.

::THE CODE::

The code was fairly simple for this one. Most of the work was done in js using prompts. The only styling I did was the jumbtron for the large header and centering the password box and copy button. Relatively easy on that side...but the js was challenging. Fortunately my tutor Sangeetha was there to help me debug
